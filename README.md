# Motion Recognition Supervised Classification Model

This model is majorly focused on handicapped people. We know that it is really difficult to be dependent on someone. We hope that this model will make people more independent and will also make oneâ€™s life beautiful. We are considering the people who are unable to walk and use a wheelchair for their mobility. We are planning to make their wheelchair a smart wheelchair.
The results of this model are obtained by using Arduino Uno, Jupyter/Spyder, Arduino IDE, Servo motor and Accelerometer (MPU6050), jumper wires.
We used an accelerometer to get the reading of the motion of the head. It is done by deploying an accelerometer in a cap which a patient should wear to control the wheelchair. We created a dataset of directions LEFT, RIGHT, FORWARD, BACKWARD to get training data.
In the Jupyter Notebook accuracy has been obtained.

The machine learning algorithm will predict and decide the direction of the movement of the wheelchair as the head of the patient is moved in likewise direction.
